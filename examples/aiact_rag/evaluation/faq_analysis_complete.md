## Summary of Analysis

Total Questions Analyzed: 45
Average Scores:
- Context Score: 2.51
- Answer Score: 2.60
- Groundedness Score: 4.67

Key Observations:
1. Exceptional groundedness (4.67/5) - system consistently acknowledges limitations
2. Context availability varies significantly (2.51/5) - many topics lack context
3. Answer quality correlates strongly with context availability
4. System excels at maintaining honesty about information gaps
5. Technical topics have better context than procedural ones

Strengths:
1. Perfect groundedness when admitting lack of information
2. Excellent handling of technical definitions
3. Strong performance on clearly defined regulatory requirements
4. Consistent citation of sources when available
5. Good explanation of system classifications and obligations

Areas for Improvement:
1. Coverage of implementation timelines
2. Details about compliance procedures
3. Information about governance and oversight
4. Guidance on practical application
5. Specifics about exemptions and special cases

Recommendations:
1. Expand context coverage for procedural aspects
2. Include more implementation details
3. Add specific examples for various scenarios
4. Provide more detailed guidance for different stakeholders
5. Include more information about compliance mechanisms

The analysis reveals a system that is highly reliable in acknowledging its limitations but would benefit from expanded context in many areas. The strong correlation between context availability and answer quality suggests that improving the knowledge base would significantly enhance performance.
