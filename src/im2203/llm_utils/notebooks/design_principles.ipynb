    "In this lab, we are going to build an interactive chatbot using a modular, object-oriented architecture designed around LLM (Large Language Model) utilities. The goal is not just to create a working chatbot, but to demonstrate how object-oriented design patterns, SOLID principles, and software architecture best practices can be applied in a real-world AI system. We’ll start by examining the UML class diagram, which outlines the key components of our system—such as the LLMFactory, the different LLMBuilder implementations, and the ConversationManager—and how they interact. Throughout the session, you’ll see how patterns like Factory, Builder, and Strategy work together to make the chatbot extensible and maintainable, while principles like Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion ensure clean separation of concerns. By the end of the lab, you’ll understand not only how to instantiate and configure different language models (like OpenAI, LM Studio, or HuggingFace) through a unified interface, but also how thoughtful design choices lead to flexible and scalable software systems."

    "## Architectural notes:\n",
    "The architecture is layered because the system is organized into distinct levels of responsibility — from model creation (via factories and builders) to orchestration (conversation management) to execution (model invocation) and finally to the user interface. Each layer depends only on the one below it, promoting clear separation of concerns and easier maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is partially event-driven because the conversation flow — handled internally through LangGraph — reacts to state changes and transitions between nodes based on events, rather than following a strictly linear, procedural sequence. This event-driven behavior is localized within the conversation management layer, while the overall system structure remains layered."

    "To better understand how the components interact in this architecture, let's follow the flow of what happens when a user wants to chat with an LMStudio-based local LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization Phase**:\n",
    "   - The application starts by loading configuration from YAML files:\n",
    "     - `config.yaml` contains model configurations for different LLM providers\n",
    "     - `conversation.yaml` defines memory and conversation parameters\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - `LLMFactory` is instantiated to create the appropriate LLM implementation\n",
    "   - The factory identifies \"lmstudio\" as the requested model type\n",
    "   - It retrieves the `LMStudioBuilder` from its registry of builders\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Building Phase**:\n",
    "   - `LMStudioBuilder` is activated with configuration parameters:\n",
    "     - `model_name: \"qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m\"`\n",
    "     - `base_url: \"http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1\"`\n",
    "     - `temperature: 0.0`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - The builder validates the connection to the local LM Studio server\n",
    "   - It constructs a `ChatOpenAI` instance configured to communicate with the local server\n",
    "   - The builder returns this instance to the factory, which returns it to the client\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversation Setup Phase**:\n",
    "   - `ConversationManager` is created with the LLM instance\n",
    "   - It loads conversation configuration (memory settings, etc.)\n",
    "   - It builds a LangGraph state graph for managing conversation flow\n",
    "   - Each node in the graph represents a processing stage for messages\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interaction Phase**:\n",
    "   - User sends a message via `chat(message)`\n",
    "   - The message is wrapped as a `HumanMessage` object\n",
    "   - The message enters the state graph as part of the conversation state\n",
    "   - The graph executes the `call_model` node, which:\n",
    "     - Applies memory management (trimming based on configured strategy)\n",
    "     - Invokes the LLM with the current message context\n",
    "     - Captures the response and adds it to the conversation state\n",
    "   - The response is extracted and returned to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Memory Management**:\n",
    "   - Throughout this process, the `ConversationManager` maintains conversation history\n",
    "   - Messages are trimmed according to the configured strategy (e.g., keeping last N messages)\n",
    "   - The conversation state is preserved for subsequent interactions\n",
    "   - Users can retrieve the full conversation history or reset it as needed"
