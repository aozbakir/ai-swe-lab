      "question": "What is the AI Act, and what are its objectives?",
      "reference_answer": "The EU AI Act is the world's first comprehensive AI law. It aims to promote innovation and uptake of AI, while ensuring a high level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights, including democracy and the rule of law. The uptake of AI systems has a strong potential to bring societal benefits, economic growth and enhance EU innovation and global competitiveness. However, in certain cases, the specific characteristics of certain AI systems may create risks related to user safety, including physical safety, and fundamental rights. Some powerful AI models that are widely used could also pose systemic risks. This leads to legal uncertainty and potentially slower uptake of AI technologies by public authorities, businesses and citizens, due to the lack of trust. Disparate regulatory responses by national authorities could risk fragmenting the internal market. Responding to these challenges, legislative action was needed to ensure a well-functioning internal market for AI systems and models where both benefits and risks are adequately addressed.",
      "generated_answer": "The AI Act, as mentioned in the context provided, is titled \"2020/1828 (Artificial Intelligence Act) (OJ L, 2024/1689, 12.7.2024, ELI: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj).\" This act is aimed at regulating artificial intelligence systems in the European Union to ensure their safety and security.\n\nThe objectives of the AI Act include:\n- Ensuring that AI systems are developed and used in a way that respects human rights, democratic values, and the rule of law.\n- Protecting the health, safety, and fundamental rights of individuals by setting out rules for the development and deployment of AI systems.\n- Providing legal certainty to businesses and other stakeholders involved in the AI ecosystem.\n\nSpecifically, the act aims to:\n1. Prevent the use of AI technologies that pose a risk to human life or health (Article 3).\n2. Ensure high levels of safety and security by setting out rules for the development and deployment of AI systems.\n3. Promote innovation while ensuring that AI is used responsibly.\n\nFor instance, it addresses how AI systems should be managed when they are components of large-scale IT systems established by certain legal acts (Article 111). It also emphasizes the importance of codes of practice drawn up, reviewed, and adapted to ensure compliance with obligations under this Regulation (point 116).\n\nIn summary, the AI Act seeks to balance the benefits of AI technology with the need for robust regulation to protect individuals and society as a whole.",

      "question": "When does the AI Act go into effect? What is its timeline for implementation?",
      "reference_answer": "The AI Act applies progressively, with a full roll-out by 2 August 2027. The prohibitions, definitions and provisions related to AI literacy became applicable on 2 February 2025; The rules on governance and the obligations for general-purpose AI models became applicable on 2 August 2025; The obligations regarding high-risk systems listed in Annex III, the transparency requirements (Article 50) as well as the measures in support of innovation will apply as of 2 August 2026. This is also the date when the enforcement of AI Act will start; The obligations for high-risk AI systems that classify as high-risk because they are embedded in regulated products, listed in Annex I (list of Union harmonisation legislation), will enter into force on 2 August 2027.",
      "generated_answer": "The Artificial Intelligence Act (2020/1828) goes into effect as of 12 July 2024, as specified in the provided context. Specifically, it states that the regulation came into force on this date (\"OJ L, 2024/1689, 12.7.2024\"). \n\nFor implementation timelines:\n- Providers have until May 2025 to demonstrate compliance with the new regulations.\n- Member States are required to lay down and notify rules on penalties, including administrative fines, by the date of application of this Regulation (i.e., by 12 July 2024).\n- The implementing act included in the plan should be adopted by 2 February 2026.\n\nThese timelines ensure that providers have sufficient time to comply with the new regulations while also allowing Member States and relevant authorities to establish necessary rules and procedures.",

      "question": "Are revisions to the AI Act expected in the near future?",
      "reference_answer": "The AI Act is designed as a flexible and future-proof regulation that allows to adapt the rules to the rapid pace of technological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems and emerging risks. While in general the AI Act can only be amended through the legislative procedure, in certain cases, the Commission is empowered to amend certain parts of the AI Act. For instance, the following parts of the AI Act can be adapted by the Commission: The list of high-risk use-cases in Annex III. The Commission is obliged to carry out a yearly review to assess if changes to the list are needed. The threshold above which general-purpose AI models are presumed to have high impact capabilities and are classified as presenting systemic risks. The Commission also regularly assesses if other changes to the AI Act are needed and reports to the European Parliament and the Council. Such regular evaluation is foreseen directly in the AI Act.",
      "generated_answer": "I don't find this information in the provided context.\n\nThe context focuses on specific deadlines for compliance with the AI Regulation, including dates by which providers and deployers need to comply. It also mentions periodic reports that the Commission shall submit regarding the review of progress but does not provide any indication or expectation of near-future revisions to the AI Act. Therefore, based solely on the provided context, there is no information supporting an expectation of near-future revisions to the AI Act.",
